        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Caldo de Res is a hearty, savory beef and vegetable soup that is a popular and comforting dish. It features slow-cooked beef, often bone-in shank or short ribs, in a flavorful broth with a variety of vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, corn on the cob, and squash (güisquil or ayote). It is typically served with a side of rice and garnished with fresh elements like cilantro, lime wedges, and avocado.

<p>The dish itself has roots within Central America ranging from Mexico to Costa Rica, so there are different iterations of the soup that include different ingredients, but for the sake of this recipe, we'll be following the Guatemalan version.</p>
