    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Moqueca is a rich, aromatic seafood stew featuring tender fish or shellfish cooked in a flavorful broth of coconut milk,
        tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. A key ingredient in the popular "moqueca baiana" version is red palm oil
        (dendê oil) , which gives the stew a vibrant color and distinct flavor. It is often garnished with fresh
        cilantro and served with rice or farofa (toasted cassava flour)</p>
